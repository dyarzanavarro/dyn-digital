      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

      <p>
        Your privacy is important to me. It is my, Daniel Navarro, policy to
        respect your privacy regarding any information I may collect from you
        across my website, konstantin.digital. I only ask for personal
        information when I truly need it to provide a service to you. I collect
        it by fair and lawful means, with your knowledge and consent. I also let
        you know why I am collecting it and how it will be used. I only retain
        collected information for as long as necessary to provide you with your
        requested service. What data I store, I'll protect within commercially
        acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorised
        access, disclosure, copying, use or modification. I don’t share any
        personally identifying information publicly or with third-parties,
        except when required to by law. My website may link to external sites
        that are not operated by me. Please be aware that I have no control over
        the content and practices of these sites, and cannot accept
        responsibility or liability for their respective privacy policies. You
        are free to refuse my request for your personal information, with the
        understanding that I may be unable to provide you with some of your
        desired services. Your continued use of my website will be regarded as
        acceptance of my practices around privacy and personal information. If
        you have any questions about how I handle user data and personal
        information, feel free to contact me. This policy is effective as of
        April 2020.

      <b>Liability for Contents</b>
      <p>
        As service providers, we are liable for own contents of these websites.
        However, service providers are not obligated to permanently monitor
        submitted or stored information or to search for evidences that indicate
        illegal activities. Legal obligations to removing information or to
        blocking the use of information remain unchallenged. In this case,
        liability is only possible at the time of knowledge about a specific
        violation of law. Illegal contents will be removed immediately at the
        time we get knowledge of them.
      </p>

      <b>Liability for Links</b>
      <p>
        Our offer includes links to external third party websites. We have no
        influence on the contents of those websites, therefore we cannot
        guarantee for those contents. Providers or administrators of linked
        websites are always responsible for their own contents. The linked
        websites had been checked for possible violations of law at the time of
        the establishment of the link. Illegal contents were not detected at the
        time of the linking. A permanent monitoring of the contents of linked
        websites cannot be imposed without reasonable indications that there has
        been a violation of law. Illegal links will be removed immediately at
        the time we get knowledge of them.
      </p>

      <b>Copyright</b>
      <p>
        Contents and compilations published on these websites by the providers
        are subject to Swiss copyright laws. Reproduction, editing, distribution
        as well as the use of any kind outside the scope of the copyright law
        require a written permission of the author or originator. Downloads and
        copies of these websites are permitted for private use only. The
        commercial use of our contents without permission of the originator is
        prohibited. Copyright laws of third parties are respected as long as the
        contents on these websites do not originate from the provider.
        Contributions of third parties on this site are indicated as such.
        However, if you notice any violations of copyright law, please inform
        us. Such contents will be removed immediately.
